# Digital AVIS

This is a personal project hoping to help many AVIS (Italian Blood Donors Associations) locally set up their digital presence.

There is a real need to uniform and standardize the way AVIS handle each local website, especially from the booking point of view.

The main scope of this repository is to have a common and simple solution for all local AVIS chapter to manage bookings of donations.

In case you want to contribute, feel free to ping me. :)

Cheers,
Christian
